We are developing a token transfer bridge. Now it is based on Celo
[Optics](https://github.com/celo-org/optics-monorepo/). Optics is a n-ary chain
bridge and has good balance between efficiency and trust assumption. We optimize
general purpose Optics for token transfer only. We plan user interface
improvements such as progress indicator and fee estimation. We want to prevent
remote token fragmentation, too.
